Dear Mr. George Washington,

Yes George, it looks like you are our lucky #1 winner.
Don't wait a second George. Respond to this letter within ##4## days.
We have a blue carriage with George Washington written all over it.
But if we don't hear from you soon
George, we will keep the carriage for ourselves.
    Yours Truly,
       Dewey,
       Chetem,
       and Howe
