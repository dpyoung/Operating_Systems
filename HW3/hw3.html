59000-01 - Programming Assignment 3
</h1>

<p>
This assignment has four parts. The four parts are Programming Exercises 3.11, 3.18, 3.13, and implementing <code>touch</code>, from the end of Chapter 3 in the textbook (pages 105-106).
Please download this <a href="hw3.zip">zip file</a>.
Be sure to review the homework <a href="http://math.purduecal.edu/~rlkraft/cs50300/criteria.html">grading criteria</a>.
This assignment is due Tuesday, March 3.
</p>

<p>
Part 1: As the book mentions on page 95, ls2 has a bug. Write a program called <code>ls3.c</code> that fixes this bug. In the opening comment of your file <code>ls3.c</code>, put an explanation of what caused the bug and what you did to fix it. (Don't write just two sentences. Write a detailed explanation of the bug and its solution.)
</p>

<p>
Part 2: Do a slightly modified version of Programming Exercise 3.18 on page 106 of the textbook. Modify your <code>ls3.c</code>, and call it <code>ls4.c</code>, so that it takes a command-line option <code>-R</code> that means recursive directory listings (you are really implementing the command "ls -alR" since we are outputting directory listings in the long format).
</p>

<p>
Part 3: Do a slightly modified version of Programming Exercise 3.13 on page 106. Modify your program <code>cp1a.c</code> (from Assignment 2), and call it <code>cp2.c</code>, so that it implements copying files to a directory. The syntax of your command should be
</p>
<pre>
        cp2 [-n] SOURCE    DEST
        cp2 [-n] SOURCE... DIRECTORY
</pre>
<p>
Your program should copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY (notice that the second line is what's new).
</p>

<p>
Part 4: Write a simplified version of the <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/touch.1.html">touch</a> command. The syntax for your command should be
</p>
<pre>
        touch FILE...
</pre>
<p>
Your program should update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time. Also, a FILE argument that does not exist is created empty. (Make sure your program fails with appropriate error messages. For example, if a user tries to touch a file that they do not have permission to modify.)
</p>

<p>
Write a <code>Makefile</code> that builds your programs for the above four parts. Make sure your make file works correctly. I will compile your code using your make file. If it doesn't work, I won't be able to grade your assignment.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://cs.purduecal.edu/~rlkraft/cs50300/handin.html">Turn in</a> a zip file called <code>CS59000Hw3Surname.zip</code> (where <code>Surname</code> is your last name) containing your C programs <code>ls3.c</code>, <code>ls4.c</code>, <code>cp2.c</code>, <code>touch.c</code>, and your make file <code>Makefile</code>.
</p>
